# pi zero webcam 
This python scripts starts a webcam stream via http on port 8000
It works on a pi zero as well

## installation
```
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/sybnex/webcam.git
cd webcam && bash install.sh
```

The python script will be installed as a systemd daemon and boots automatically

## docker container
I was trying to get it run under docker but it is failing somehow.  
Feel free to resolve it.
